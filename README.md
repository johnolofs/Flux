# **üåê Timpi Node Deployment Guide**

This guide covers two separate methods for deploying Timpi Nodes:

* **FluxCloud** ‚Äì for simplified and affordable Collector, and Geocore Node deployment via the Flux Marketplace.

* **FluxEdge** ‚Äì for advanced, customizable infrastructure with Synaptron and Collector nodes.

---

### **Step 2: Configure Your Collector Node**

1. **Open Application Management**

   * In the left-hand menu, go to **Applications ‚Üí Management**.

   * Under **My Active Apps**, locate your **Timpi Deployment**.

   * Click **Manage**, then confirm in the pop-up.

<img width="1917" height="987" alt="image17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5271e09-8ea4-4f85-bd77-06b96349477e" />

2. **Understand the Deployment Structure**

   * Your deployment runs on **three independent servers**, allowing you to operate up to **three Timpi Collector Nodes** from a single deployment.

   * Complete the configuration steps 3-5 below for all your server IPs of your deployment.

3. **Access the Running Instance**

   * On the management screen, go to the **Running Instances** tab (located under **Global App Management**).

   * Click the **App** button next to any server IP to open the node interface in a new browser tab.

<img width="1919" height="990" alt="image10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65e8943a-31b0-4832-b808-2548eeee975b" />

4. **Configure the Node Settings**

   * In the node interface, click the **Settings** icon.

   * Enter your **Timpi Wallet Address** *(must hold a Timpi NFT)*.

   * Set the **Number of Workers** (1‚Äì5).

   * Click **Save**.

<img width="1558" height="938" alt="image5 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91e3f515-7e75-47ba-a2d1-c72e510469ac" />


5. **Start Indexing**

   * Return to the **Collector** tab in the node interface header.

   * Your node should now begin indexing pages.

**Note:** Periodically check the server IPs, as they may rotate. Due to the nature of FluxCloud, if a server experiences downtime, the Collector Node may be redeployed to a new server with a different IP address. If this happens, simply repeat the steps above to configure the wallet address and number of workers via the Timpi Collector Node GUI on the new IP.

### **Step 2: Add Timpi Collector Nodes (Same Machine)** 

As you are already paying for the whole machine that your synaptron node is running on, it makes sense to use the unused resources of that machine to deploy further Timpi Collector Nodes on top of it. You can redo the below process and deploy **multiple Collector Nodes** alongside your Synaptron Node on the same machine.

Follow the steps below to get started:

1. On the machine overview, click the **three dots** on the machine row, where you have your Synaptron Node already running, then click **\+ New Deployment.**

2. Click on **Explore All Templates** at the Quick launch section, and search for **Timpi Collector**, and click on it. 

3. Read the README if you want to learn more about how the application works. Continue the deployment process by clicking on the **Builder** tab or **Continue** button to configure your application specifications.

4. Adjust resources, or keep them at recommended values, and click on the **Deploy App** button.

5. You will get forwarded to the **Deployment Overview** of your application. Wait until your application has the status running, and click the app URL link.

6. In the newly opened tab, click the **Settings icon**. Then enter your **Timpi Wallet address** (must hold a Timpi NFT), and set the Number **of Workers** from 1 to 5, and save it by clicking the **Save** button

7. Go back to the **Collector tab** in the header. Your node should now begin **indexing pages**
